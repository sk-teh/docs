        :alt: AO component

    **AO** is the component provides an interface for the physical analogue output point that is able to source/drive a 0 to 20mA current or 0 to 10V voltage signal. 
    The output type is selected via AO configuration and hardware jumper setting.
    
    The analogue output provides 16 levels of prioritized command to control to the physical point. 
    **In1** has the highest priority whereas **In16** has the lowest. 
    The input may have a commanded value (valid floating value) or a null value (usually NaN in floating point). 
    A *null* value indicates that there is no value (or not active) in that priority. 
    The analogue output continuously monitors all prioritized inputs (**In1** to **In16**) to locate the entry with the highest priority non-NULL value and outputs it.

                - *Physical Value* = *Physical Calculated Value* (%) * (*Out High* - *Out Low*) + *Out Low*
                - **Out** (%) = 100 * **Out**/ (**ScaleHigh** - **ScaleLow**)

                    AO uses the **scalelow** and **scalehigh** to convert the output value to physical value. Raw value register shows the physical output.
                        - Physical Value = (**Out** (%)) * (**ScaleHigh** - **ScaleLow**)

    Whereby the other eights are derived from universal input (*UI* or *AI*) using value conversion (DI9 to D16). *DI1* to *DI8* might have different characteristics comparing to *DI9* to *DI16* depend on the AI settings. 
    Please refer to AI component section regarding the conversion.

    **DO** is used for switching a physical digital output point *OFF* or *ON*. 
    The typical usage is starting/stopping the external equipment such as light, valve, fan or any other digital control equipment. 
    The DO component monitors the required set state and determines the proper hardware output action based on its settings. 
    There are eight digital output points on *IO28U/IO22U/DDC28P* controller. 
    Each of them is driven by a dry contact relay (SPST Relay) which is able to drive the external devices up to 1 Ampere (AC/DC).
    
    Digital output is a prioritized command with 16 priorities control plus a default value (relinquish default). 
    *In1* has the highest priority while in16 has the lowest. In6 is reserved for minimum/maximum time controlling. 
    The value can be commanded value (false = 0, true = 1) or a *null* value (= 2).
